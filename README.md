# 04 Web APIs: Personal Blog

## My Task

In this challenge, I have created a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. 

## User Story

As a learning student, I've created this blog to showcase my thought and experiences. My file structure should look like the following:

my-blog
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── blog.css
│   │   └── styles.css
│   └── js
│       ├── blog.js
│       └── logic.js
├── index.html
├── blog.html
└── README.md

## Mock-Up
